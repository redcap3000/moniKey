        PHP Library to simplify mongodb interactions into one overloaded static method class.

        Later versions may support other methods to do other things with mongo.

        Most object calls return arrays, and convert mongo id's to normal strings.

        All functions take the name and database as final arguments, but should ideally be defined by calling classes.
